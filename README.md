# Java String Comparison: Reference vs Value

A practical guide for Java beginners explaining why `==` operator fails for String comparison and why `.equals()` method should be used instead. This repository includes working code examples demonstrating the difference between reference comparison and value comparison, with detailed explanations of Java's memory model (Stack vs Heap).

## What You'll Learn
- The difference between primitives and objects in Java
- How Stack and Heap memory work
- Why `==` compares references (memory addresses)
- Why `.equals()` compares actual content
- Best practices for String comparison in Java

Perfect for beginners who encountered the "String values are compared using '==', not 'equals()'" warning and want to understand the underlying reason.
